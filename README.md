# Standards, Protocols, and Best Practices

We strictly follow existing standards, protocols, and best practices, and we define our own only if they do not exist.

We adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Do Standards Exist for What We Want to Do?**  
   - **YES**: If a standard exists, we MUST use it.  
   - **NO**:   
     - We MUST question what we want to use.  
     - We MUST try to find a relevant standard.  
     - We SHOULD rethink the implementation to be able to use existing standards.  

2. **Is There a Library That Does What We Are About to Do?**  
   - If a library exists, we MUST use it.  

3. **Only If All Other Options Have Been Exhausted:**  
   - We MAY implement a new library, but we MUST make sure that if we do, we MUST follow standards, and we MUST be quick in removing our implementation when an existing library is updated to include this feature.  
   - We SHOULD NOT write and maintain any code that already exists or if new code or features come on code we have written, we SHOULD delete our code to use existing libraries in the form of standards or libraries.
